INSERT INTO `quranic_verses_guidecontent` VALUES (1,'The Quran is divided into 114 Surahs (chapters) and further divided into Ayahs (verses). The real translation of the word Ayat is actually “Sign [of Allah]”. For a preliminary discussion about the chronological order of chapters see page Surah.\r\n\r\nEach surah, except for the ninth is preceded by the phrase bismi-llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīm (“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.”). 29 surahs are preceded by Muqatta’at (lit. abbreviated or shortened), unique letter combinations whose meanings remain unclear. The first surah in the Quran is Surah al-Fatihah.',1),(2,'The first chapter of the Holy Quran is Al-Fatiha, and contains 7 verses and was revealed in Makkah. Some of its English titles include The Opening, The Opening of the Divine Writ, The Surah of Praise, The Foundation of the Qur’an, andThe Seven Oft-Repeated [Verses].\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this chapter is that it is the “seed” of the whole Qur’ān.',1),(3,'Surah Al-Ankabut is known as \'The Spider\' and it is the chapter number 29 in the Quran. The sura has been named Ankabut because of ayat no.41 which talks of the fragility of the false gods, comparing them to the web of a spider.\r\n\r\nCommentators of the Holy Qur\'an state that this sura talks about the following main subjects;\r\n\r\n1. The trial of a believer and the distinguishing factors of hypocrites.\r\n\r\nIn difficult times the real believers can be separated from those who only claim belief.\r\n\r\n2. Narrations of previous Prophets and the opposition faced by them. This is to inspire true believers to face troubles and obstacles in the way of Allah.\r\n\r\n3. Oneness of Allah and the signs of Allah in His creation.\r\n\r\nThe sura also briefly covers other topics.\r\n\r\nOverall the sura is meant to strengthen believers in their dedication to the right path.',1),(4,'Surah Al-Baqarah the second chapter of the Quran is referred to as the Cow.\r\n\r\nWhy the name AL-BAQARAH? AL-BAQARAH (the Cow) has been so named from the story of the Cow occurring in this Surah (vv. 67-73). It has not, however, been used as a title to indicate the subject of the Surah. It will, therefore, be as wrong to translate the name Al-Baqarah into \"The Cow\" or \"The Heifer\" as to translate any English name, say Baker, Rice, Wolf etc., into their equivalents in other languages or vice versa, because this would imply that the Surah dealt with the subject of \"The Cow\". Many more Surahs of the Quran have been named in the same way because no comprehensive words exist in Arabic (in spite of its richness) to denote the wide scope of the subject discussed in them. As a matter of fact all human languages suffer from the same limitation.',1),(5,'One of the chapters known as Surah Al Asr, that translates as “In the name of God, Lord of Mercy, Giver of Mercy. By time, man is at a loss, except for those who believe, take righteous action, urge one another to truth, and urge one another to steadfastness”\r\n\r\nMost of us have heard this surah hundreds of times. It is one of the last 14 surahs of the Quran, known as the ‘oft-repeated’ surahs.  This morning as fajr entered, I had an epiphany as I reflected on this verse. As I share it with you, take what is of benefit, and leave what is not. I pray this will bring you closer to the ‘truth’.\r\n\r\nThis short surah teaches humanity four of the most important values we need to inculcate to improve ourselves: belief, action, truth, and steadfastness.',1),(6,'Certainly, the Quran mentions several fruits in its verses. Here are three points about some of the fruits mentioned in the Quran:\r\n\r\nDates (Tamar):\r\n\r\nAbundantly Mentioned: Dates are one of the most frequently mentioned fruits in the Quran. They are often cited as a symbol of blessings and sustenance from Allah.\r\nHistorical Significance: Dates have historical and cultural significance in the Arabian Peninsula and were a staple food for the people of the region during the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\r\nSpiritual Symbolism: Dates are often associated with the breaking of fasts during Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad recommended breaking one\'s fast with dates, emphasizing their nutritious and revitalizing qualities.',2),(7,'Grapes (Inab):\r\n\r\nSign of God\'s Creation: Grapes are mentioned in the Quran as one of the signs of God\'s creation. They serve as a reminder of Allah\'s creative power and His generosity in providing sustenance for humanity.\r\n\r\nUsed in Making Wine: While the Quran acknowledges the benefits of grapes, it also cautions against the harmful effects of wine and intoxicants made from grapes in several verses, highlighting the importance of moderation and avoiding harmful substances.\r\n\r\nSymbol of Paradise: Grapes are also mentioned in the Quran as one of the fruits of Paradise, where they are described as being easily accessible to the residents of Paradise.',2),(8,'Olives (Zaytun):\r\n\r\nHealth Benefits: The Quran mentions the olive tree and its oil, highlighting its various benefits, including its use for food and as a source of healing. Olive oil is recognized for its health benefits and nutritional value.\r\n\r\nSymbol of Light: In Surah An-Nur (24:35), the Quran metaphorically refers to the light of Allah as being like a blessed olive tree, further emphasizing the positive symbolism associated with olives.\r\n\r\nCultural and Culinary Significance: Olives have been a part of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine for centuries and have cultural significance in these regions. Olive oil is widely used in cooking and is considered a symbol of purity and goodness.',2),(9,'Pomegranates:\r\n\r\nMention in the Quran: Pomegranates are mentioned in the Quran in Surah Ar-Rahman (55:068):\r\n\r\n\"In both of them are fruit and palm trees and pomegranates.\" (Quran 55:68)\r\n\r\nThis verse is part of a larger passage in which Allah describes the blessings and provisions He has provided for humanity. Pomegranates are cited as one of the fruits that are among these blessings.\r\n\r\nSymbolism of Abundance: Pomegranates in this context symbolize God\'s abundant provision for His creation. They are seen as a sign of His generosity and a reminder of the diversity and richness of the natural world that He has created.\r\n\r\nCultural and Historical Significance: Pomegranates have been cultivated and appreciated in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions for thousands of years. They have a rich history in various cultures and ar',2),(10,'Dealing with people is a fundamental aspect of human life, and the Quran provides guidance on how to interact with others in a just, compassionate, and ethical manner. Here are three points about dealing with people as mentioned in the Quran:\r\n\r\nJustice and Fairness (Adl and Qist):\r\n\r\nThe Quran emphasizes the importance of justice and fairness in all dealings with people. Surah An-Nisa (4:58) states, \"Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people, judge with justice.\" This verse highlights the obligation to fulfill one\'s responsibilities and to judge disputes equitably.\r\nBelievers are encouraged to be just and impartial in their interactions, whether in financial transactions, legal matters, or personal relationships. Treating people with equity and fairness is a fundamental principle in Islam.',3),(11,'Compassion and Kindness (Rahma and Ihsan):\r\n\r\nThe Quran encourages believers to show compassion and kindness to others. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:267) reminds Muslims about the significance of giving to those in need: \"O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned.\"\r\nActs of charity, helping the less fortunate, and showing empathy towards others are highly valued in Islam. The concept of \"ihsan\" (excellence in behavior) promotes going beyond mere justice to show kindness and generosity to fellow human beings.',3),(12,'Respect and Dignity (Karama):\r\n\r\nThe Quran teaches that every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances, possesses inherent dignity and should be treated with respect. Surah Al-Hujurat (49:11) emphasizes this point: \"O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them.\"\r\nBelievers are advised to avoid mocking or belittling others and to maintain a sense of humility and respect in their interactions. This includes refraining from harmful gossip, backbiting, and slander.',3),(13,'In summary, the Quran provides clear guidance on how to deal with people by emphasizing justice, compassion, kindness, and respect. These principles serve as a moral compass for believers in their interactions with others, fostering harmonious and ethical relationships in society.',3),(14,'The Quran mentions various natural elements, including flowers, as signs of God\'s creation and His blessings. Here are three points about flowers mentioned in the Quran:\r\n\r\nLilies (Sousan):\r\n\r\nLilies are mentioned in the Quran in Surah Al-Waqi\'ah (56:28) as part of the descriptions of Paradise (Jannah). The verse states: \"And [they will be] among lote trees with thorns removed.\"\r\nIn this context, lilies symbolize the beauty and abundance of Paradise. They are described as part of the delightful landscape in the hereafter, where believers will enjoy the rewards of their faith and good deeds.',4),(15,'Other Mentioned Plants and Foliage:\r\n\r\nWhile the Quran doesn\'t specifically mention a wide variety of flowers by name, it frequently references plants, trees, and gardens in general as symbols of God\'s creation and His blessings.\r\nFor example, in Surah Ar-Rahman (55:68), the Quran mentions various fruits, palm trees, and gardens as signs of God\'s bounties. This verse emphasizes the diverse and abundant vegetation created by Allah for the benefit of humanity.',4),(16,'Symbolism and Reflection:\r\n\r\nThe Quran often uses elements of the natural world, including flowers and plants, to invite reflection on God\'s creation and His signs. These references encourage believers to contemplate the beauty, diversity, and orderliness of the natural world and recognize the Creator\'s wisdom and greatness.\r\nWhile specific flowers like lilies are mentioned in a metaphorical context, the broader theme of nature\'s beauty and its connection to spirituality is a recurring motif in the Quran.',4),(17,'In summary, the Quran mentions flowers indirectly, using them as part of its descriptions of Paradise or as symbols of God\'s creation and blessings. The primary focus is on encouraging believers to reflect on the natural world as a sign of Allah\'s wisdom and generosity and to deepen their understanding of His divine attributes.',4),(18,'The Quran contains references to natural elements, including certain foods and substances, which are sometimes interpreted as having medicinal properties. Here are three points about medicine-related references in the Quran:\r\n\r\nHoney (Asal):\r\n\r\nHoney is mentioned in the Quran in Surah An-Nahl (16:69) as a source of healing: \"Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you]. There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed, in that is a sign for a people who give thought.\"\r\nThe Quran recognizes the medicinal benefits of honey, which have been appreciated for centuries. Honey has antimicrobial properties and is used for various therapeutic purposes, including soothing sore throats and healing wounds.',5),(19,'Black Seed (Al-Habbat al-Sauda):\r\n\r\nWhile not mentioned by name in the Quran, black seed is often associated with a reference to a cure in a Hadith (Prophetic tradition) narrated by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Hadith states, \"In the black seed, there is healing for every disease except death.\"\r\nBlack seed oil, derived from Nigella sativa seeds, has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, such as its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Some interpret the Hadith as an acknowledgment of the medicinal qualities of black seed.',5),(20,'Water (Ma):\r\n\r\nWater is mentioned numerous times in the Quran as a fundamental element for life and purification. While it is not specifically described as medicine, it is highlighted for its cleansing and life-sustaining properties.\r\nThe Quran emphasizes the importance of cleanliness and purification, which often involve the use of water. Proper hygiene and cleanliness contribute to overall health and well-being, preventing disease and illness.',5),(21,'One of the most repeated phrases is \"Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem,\" which translates to \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\" Here are three points about this phrase and its significance:',6),(22,'Opening of Most Surahs: The phrase \"Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem\" serves as the opening statement of all but one of the 114 chapters (Surahs) in the Quran. Its repetition at the beginning of Surahs emphasizes the Quran\'s central theme of monotheism, God\'s mercy, and the importance of seeking His guidance in all aspects of life.\r\n\r\nDivine Attributes: The phrase highlights two fundamental attributes of Allah: \"Ar-Rahman\" (the Most Gracious) and \"Ar-Raheem\" (the Most Merciful). These attributes emphasize Allah\'s compassion, love, and benevolence toward His creation. They serve as a reminder to believers of God\'s endless mercy and His willingness to forgive and guide those who seek Him.',6),(23,'It also has a Spiritual and Practical Significance: \"Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Raheem\" is not only a phrase of invocation but also a powerful reminder for Muslims to begin their actions and endeavors with the intention of seeking God\'s blessings and guidance. It encourages believers to approach their daily activities with mindf',6),(24,'Here are three points about some of the most repeated words in the Quran:\r\n\r\n\"Allah\" (الله):\r\n\r\nThe word \"Allah\" is the most repeated word in the Quran. It is mentioned thousands of times. This emphasizes the centrality of monotheism in Islam, as \"Allah\" is the unique and supreme name for God in the Islamic faith.\r\nThe repetition of \"Allah\" underscores the focus on the worship of the One God and serves as a reminder of His omnipotence, compassion, and sovereignty.\r\nMuslims believe that the frequent mention of \"Allah\" in the Quran reinforces the importance of maintaining a deep and constant connection with God in all aspects of life.',6),(25,'\"Rahman\" (الرَّحْمَن) and \"Raheem\" (الرَّحِيم):\r\n\r\nThese two words, \"Rahman\" (the Most Gracious) and \"Raheem\" (the Most Merciful), are repeated together numerous times throughout the Quran. They describe two of Allah\'s essential attributes.\r\nThe repetition of these attributes emphasizes God\'s boundless compassion, love, and forgiveness. These attributes are a source of hope and comfort for believers, encouraging them to seek Allah\'s mercy and forgiveness in all circumstances.\r\nThe combination of \"Rahman\" and \"Raheem\" highlights the multifaceted nature of God\'s mercy—His general mercy encompassing all of creation (Rahman) and His specific mercy for believers (Raheem).',6),(26,'\"Aakhirah\" (الآخِرَة):\r\n\r\nThe word \"Aakhirah,\" meaning the Hereafter or the life after death, is frequently mentioned in the Quran. It underscores the belief in the afterlife as a central tenet of Islamic faith.\r\nThe Quran repeatedly reminds believers of the transient nature of this world and the importance of preparing for the eternal life in the Hereafter through righteous actions and faith.\r\nThe concept of the Hereafter is a recurring theme in the Quran, serving as a powerful motivator for believers to lead a life of piety, justice, and moral integrity.',6),(27,'Moral Values:\r\n\r\nTruthfulness and Honesty (Siddiq and Amanah):\r\n\r\nThe Quran places a high emphasis on truthfulness and honesty. Believers are encouraged to speak the truth and uphold honesty in all aspects of their lives. In Surah Al-Tawbah (9:119), it is stated, \"O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true.\"\r\nHonesty is not just about refraining from lying but also extends to fulfilling promises and trusts (Amanah). The Quran admonishes those who break their promises or betray trusts in Surah Al-Anfal (8:27), emphasizing the importance of trustworthiness.',7),(28,'Moral Values\r\n\r\nJustice and Fairness (Adl and Qist):\r\n\r\nThe Quran promotes the values of justice and fairness in dealings with others. Surah Al-Hujurat (49:9) states, \"And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of Allah.\"\r\nJustice is a central theme in the Quran, emphasizing that individuals should be treated impartially and that oppressive behavior is condemned.\r\nCompassion and Kindness (Rahma and Ihsan):\r\n\r\nCompassion and kindness towards fellow human beings are highly encouraged in the Quran. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:267) mentions the act of giving to those in need: \"O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned.\"\r\nThe Quran also emphasizes the concept of \"ihsan,\" which means showing excellence in behavior and going beyond mere justice to treat others with kindness and generosity.',7),(29,'Rights of People:\r\n\r\nRespect for Life and Dignity (Hayat and Karama):\r\n\r\nThe Quran emphasizes the sanctity of human life and the dignity of every individual. Surah Al-Isra (17:70) underscores the prohibition of taking innocent life: \"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.\"\r\nThis verse highlights the inherent worth and dignity of every human being.\r\nRights of Family and Neighbors (Ahl and Jar):\r\n\r\nThe Quran outlines the rights and responsibilities within families and communities. Surah An-Nisa (4:36) emphasizes kindness and justice within families: \"Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away.\"\r\nNeighbors are also given their due rights, and the Quran encourages maintaining good relations with them.',7),(30,'Rights of the Oppressed (Mustad\'af):\r\n\r\nThe Quran advocates for the rights of the oppressed and vulnerable in society. Surah Al-Nisa (4:75) encourages believers to support those who are oppressed: \"And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the cause of Allah and [for] the oppressed among men, women, and children who say, \'Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper\'?\"\r\nThis verse underscores the duty to protect and advocate for the rights of those who are marginalized or oppressed.',7),(31,'Stewardship of the Earth (Khilafah):\r\n\r\nThe Quran describes humans as stewards or vicegerents (khilafah) on Earth. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:30), it is stated, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority (khilafah).\" This verse signifies that humans have been entrusted by Allah to care for and manage the Earth.\r\nThis stewardship implies the responsibility to protect the environment, maintain the balance of nature, and use Earth\'s resources responsibly. It encourages sustainable practices and responsible management of the planet\'s resources.',8),(32,'Accountability and Good Deeds (Amal Salih):\r\n\r\nThe Quran repeatedly emphasizes the importance of performing good deeds and acting righteously. Believers are encouraged to strive for good actions and righteousness throughout their lives. In Surah Al-Kahf (18:7), it is mentioned, \"Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed.\"\r\nThis verse underscores the idea that human life is a test, and individuals will be held accountable for their deeds. Therefore, the responsibility of humans on Earth includes consistently pursuing righteous and beneficial actions.',8),(33,'Establishing Justice and Moral Values (Adl and Ihsan):\r\n\r\nThe Quran instructs humans to establish justice and moral values on Earth. In Surah Al-Hujurat (49:9), it is stated, \"And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of Allah.\"\r\nThis verse underscores the importance of resolving conflicts justly and upholding justice in society. Believers are encouraged to promote ethical and moral values, fight against oppression, and strive for a just and equitable society.',8),(34,'In summary, the Quran assigns humans the role of stewards on Earth, emphasizing their responsibility to care for the environment, perform good deeds, establish justice, and promote moral values. These responsibilities are tied to the idea of being accountable to Allah for one\'s actions and conduct on Earth, with the ultimate goal of earning His approval and guidance',8),(35,'Miracles in the Quran are supernatural events or signs attributed to the divine that serve as evidence of the truth of Islamic teachings and the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). Here are three points about miracles in the Quran:',9),(36,'The Quran as the Primary Miracle:\r\n\r\nThe Quran itself is considered the primary and most significant miracle in Islam. Muslims believe it to be the literal word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Its linguistic, literary, and rhetorical excellence, as well as its preservation over centuries, are seen as miraculous aspects.\r\nThe Quran challenges humanity to produce something similar or better, as mentioned in Surah Al-Isra (17:88): \"Say, \'If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.\'\"\r\nMuslims view the Quran\'s linguistic and literary perfection, its guidance for all aspects of life, and its ability to resonate with people of diverse backgrounds and languages as a testimony to its miraculous nature.',9),(37,'Specific Miracles of the Prophets:\r\n\r\nThe Quran narrates specific miracles performed by various prophets as signs of their divine mission. For example, the parting of the Red Sea by Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) is mentioned as a miracle in Surah Ash-Shu\'ara (26:63-66).\r\nThe Quran also mentions other miracles such as the healing of the blind and lepers by Jesus (peace be upon him) and the raising of the dead back to life (Surah Al-Imran, 3:49).\r\nThese miracles were extraordinary events that served to validate the prophethood of those messengers and reinforce the message of monotheism.',9),(38,'The Quranic Challenge:\r\n\r\nThe Quran contains challenges to those who doubt its divine origin. It challenges people to produce something similar in terms of its eloquence, guidance, and coherence. This challenge is outlined in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:23-24): \"And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful. But if you do not – and you will never be able to – then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.\"\r\nMany have attempted to meet this challenge over the centuries, but none have succeeded in replicating the Quran\'s unique qualities.\r\nThis challenge is seen as an ongoing proof of the Quran\'s miraculous nature and a test for humanity\'s understanding and appreciation of divine revelation.',9),(39,'The Quran mentions the existence of other holy books that were revealed by God to different prophets before the Quran itself. Here are three points about other holy books mentioned in the Quran:',10),(40,'Tawrat (Torah):\r\n\r\nThe Tawrat, often referred to as the Torah, is mentioned in the Quran as one of the earlier scriptures revealed by Allah. It was given to the Prophet Moses (Musa in Arabic) as guidance for the Children of Israel. The Quran acknowledges its divine origin and role as a source of guidance for the Israelites.\r\nThe Tawrat is cited in several Quranic verses, emphasizing its importance as a divine revelation. However, the Quran also mentions that over time, it underwent changes and alterations by some of its followers.\r\nThe Quran encourages the people of the Tawrat to uphold its teachings and to recognize the truth of the Quran as the final and perfected revelation.',10),(41,'Injeel (Gospel):\r\n\r\nThe Injeel, or the Gospel, is another holy book mentioned in the Quran. It is attributed to the Prophet Jesus (Isa in Arabic) and is believed to contain the teachings and message he received from God.\r\nThe Quran acknowledges the Injeel as a divine revelation and a source of guidance for the followers of Jesus. In Surah Al-Ma\'idah (5:46), it is stated, \"And We sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.\"\r\nLike the Tawrat, the Quran also highlights that the original message of the Injeel underwent changes and interpretations over time, and it encourages the followers of Jesus to recognize the Quran as the final and unaltered revelation.',10),(42,'Zabur (Psalms):\r\n\r\nThe Zabur, or the Psalms, is mentioned in the Quran as a scripture that was revealed to the Prophet David (Dawud in Arabic). It is believed to contain praises, prayers, and guidance.\r\nThe Quran acknowledges the Zabur as a divine revelation in Surah An-Nisa (4:163): \"Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the book [of Psalms].\"\r\nWhile the Quran affirms the divine origin of the Zabur, it also emphasizes the Quran as the final and complete revelation for all of humanity.',10),(43,'In summary, the Quran acknowledges the existence of other holy books, including the Tawrat, Injeel, and Zabur, and recognizes their divine origins. These scriptures are considered earlier revelations that provided guidance to their respective communities. However, the Quran is presented as the final and perfected revelation for all of humanity, and it encourages recognition of its authority and guidance.',10),(44,'The Quran emphasizes the concept of food as a blessing from Allah, highlighting its importance and significance. Here are three points about food as a blessing mentioned in the Quran:\r\n\r\nGratitude and Recognition of Blessings:\r\n\r\nThe Quran encourages believers to recognize and express gratitude for the blessings of food. In Surah Abasa (80:24-32), the Quran mentions various types of food, including grains, fruits, and meat, as signs of Allah\'s providence. It then admonishes individuals to reflect on these blessings: \"So let man observe from what he was created. He was created from a fluid, ejected, emerging from between the backbone and the ribs. Indeed, Allah, to return him [to life], is Able. The Day when secrets will be put on trial, then man will have no power or any helper.\"\r\nThis passage underscores the idea that food is a manifestation of God\'s power and a reason for gratitude.',11),(45,'Provision for Humanity:\r\n\r\nThe Quran describes food as a means of sustenance and a provision for humanity. Surah Al-Waqi\'ah (56:68-70) states, \"Have you seen that which you emit? Is it you who creates it, or are We the creator? We have decreed death among you, and We are not to be outdone.\"\r\nThese verses remind believers that Allah is the ultimate provider of food, and it is through His grace that humans are sustained. It emphasizes the idea that food is a fundamental necessity for life and a means of fulfilling human needs.',11),(46,'Sharing and Compassion:\r\n\r\nThe Quran also encourages believers to share their food with those in need and to practice compassion. Surah Al-Insan (76:8-9) discusses feeding the poor, orphans, and captives as a means of seeking Allah\'s pleasure: \"And they give food in spite of love for it to the needy, the orphan, and the captive, [saying], \'We feed you only for the countenance of Allah. We wish not from you reward or gratitude.\'\"\r\nThis verse highlights the idea that sharing one\'s food with those less fortunate is a virtuous act that pleases Allah and reflects the values of compassion, generosity, and social responsibility.',11),(47,'The concept of halal food, which refers to permissible or lawful food in Islam, is outlined in the Quran and further elaborated upon in the Hadith (Prophetic traditions). Here are three points about halal food as mentioned in the Quran:\r\n\r\nDietary Guidelines and Prohibitions:\r\n\r\nThe Quran provides dietary guidelines and prohibitions regarding what is permissible (halal) and what is forbidden (haram) for Muslims to consume. In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:168-173), it states, \"O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful (halal) and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of consuming lawful and wholesome food.\r\nThe Quran lists specific categories of food that are prohibited, such as pork and its by-products, blood, and animals that have not been slaughtered in the name of Allah (with exceptions for certain circumstances, e.g., necessity). These prohibitions are outlined in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:173) and other verses.',11),(48,'Blessing and Thankfulness:\r\n\r\nThe Quran encourages Muslims to consume halal food as a means of seeking Allah\'s blessings and expressing gratitude. In Surah Al-An\'am (6:118), it states, \"So eat of that [meat] upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if you are believers in His verses.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of mentioning Allah\'s name (saying \"Bismillah\") before eating as a way of recognizing His provision and seeking His blessings.\r\nConsuming halal food is seen as a way to maintain one\'s physical and spiritual well-being. It promotes the idea that lawful sustenance acquired through ethical means is a source of strength and righteousness.',11),(49,'Sacrifice and the Concept of Qurbani:\r\n\r\nThe Quran also discusses the concept of qurbani (sacrifice) in the context of offering animals in the name of Allah during specific occasions, such as Eid al-Adha (the Festival of Sacrifice). Surah Al-Hajj (22:36) mentions, \"And the camels and cattle We have appointed for you as among the symbols of Allah; for you therein is good.\" This verse highlights the act of sacrificing certain animals as a form of worship and obedience to Allah\'s commands.\r\nQurbani underscores the idea that food should be consumed with a sense of religious devotion and in recognition of the blessings and provisions of Allah.',11),(50,'In summary, the Quran provides guidance regarding halal food, emphasizing dietary guidelines, prohibitions, the importance of blessings and thankfulness, and the concept of qurbani. These teachings are central to Islamic dietary practices and reflect the significance of ethical and lawful consumption in the lives of Muslims.',11),(51,'Prayer and worship are central themes in the Quran, emphasizing the relationship between believers and Allah. Here are three points about prayer and worship as mentioned in the Quran:\r\n\r\nEstablishment of Regular Prayer (Salat):\r\n\r\nThe Quran repeatedly emphasizes the importance of establishing regular prayers (salat) as a fundamental act of worship. In numerous verses, such as Surah Al-Baqarah (2:45), it instructs believers to \"establish prayer\" and be steadfast in their devotion.\r\nPrayer is regarded as a means of maintaining a close connection with Allah, seeking His guidance, and seeking forgiveness for one\'s sins. It serves as a daily reminder of one\'s submission to God and dependence on His guidance.',12),(52,'Fulfillment of Religious Duties (Ibadah):\r\n\r\nThe Quran describes the concept of worship (ibadah) as a comprehensive way of life encompassing acts of devotion, morality, and righteous deeds. In Surah Az-Zumar (39:11-12), it states, \"Say, \'Indeed, I have been commanded to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion. And I have been commanded to be the first [among you] of the Muslims.\'\"\r\nWorship in Islam goes beyond ritual acts and includes ethical conduct, justice, and kindness. It encourages believers to live their lives in accordance with the values and principles of Islam.',12),(53,'Praise, Gratitude, and Remembrance (Dhikr):\r\n\r\nThe Quran highlights the importance of praising Allah, expressing gratitude, and remembering Him in various ways. Surah Al-Ahzab (33:41-42) emphasizes the idea of continuous remembrance: \"O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance. And exalt Him morning and afternoon.\"\r\nDhikr (remembrance) can take various forms, including recitation of Quranic verses, supplication (du\'a), and expressions of praise. These acts of remembrance are seen as a way to maintain a spiritual connection with Allah and to seek His guidance, protection, and blessings.',12);

It is recited in every unit of the Muslim prayer (Salah), making it an integral part of a Muslim\'s daily worship. Here are some key aspects of the significance of Surah Al-Fatiha:\r\n\r\nOpening of the Quran: Surah Al-Fatiha serves as the opening chapter of the Quran, introducing the themes and concepts that will be further expounded upon in the rest of the scripture. It sets the tone for the reader\'s engagement with the Quran\'s teachings.\r\n\r\nEssence of Worship: Surah Al-Fatiha encapsulates the core themes of monotheism, worship, and submission to God. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging Allah\'s greatness, seeking His guidance, and expressing devotion.\r\n\r\nThe Pinnacle of Prayer: Al-Fatiha is an essential component of the Muslim prayer (Salah). It is recited in every unit (Rak\'ah) of the prayer, demonstrating its centrality to the act of worship and the believer\'s connection with Allah.\r\n\r\nComprehensive Meaning: Although it consists of only seven verses, Surah Al-Fatiha conveys a comprehensive range of spiritual and moral concepts. It covers themes such as monotheism, gratitude, guidance, seeking help, forgiveness, and the Day of Judgment.\r\n\r\nDialogue with God: The structure of Surah Al-Fatiha presents a unique aspect of direct communication with Allah. The first part of the Surah is in the form of praising Allah, while the second part consists of requests and supplications made by the believer.\r\n\r\nUniversal Applicability: The themes addressed in Surah Al-Fatiha are universal and applicable to all times and places. It provides guidance for believers across diverse cultures, contexts, and circumstances.\r\n\r\nGateway to the Quranic Message: Many scholars consider Surah Al-Fatiha to be a concise summary of the entire Quranic message. It outlines the fundamental concepts of faith, worship, and righteous living that are elaborated upon in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nSpiritual Reflection and Connection: Muslims recite Surah Al-Fatiha multiple times a day during their prayers. This frequent recitation allows for continuous reflection on its meanings and a deeper spiritual connection with its teachings.\r\n\r\nBasis for Seeking Knowledge: Surah Al-Fatiha encourages believers to seek Allah\'s guidance and knowledge. It serves as a reminder that all understanding and wisdom come from Allah, and believers should continually seek His enlightenment.\r\n\r\nHealing and Blessings: Surah Al-Fatiha is also regarded by many Muslims as a source of blessings and spiritual healing. It is often recited for supplications and seeking Allah\'s help and mercy.','2023-09-04 03:17:29.269578','2023-09-04 03:17:29.264557',1,NULL,''),(51,'How should the verse number 5 of surah fatiha be interpreted in light of other verses and Hadith (Prophetic traditions)?','Surah Al-Fatiha, verse 5 (Ayah 5) states:\r\n\r\n\"Guide us to the straight path,\" (Quran 1:5)\r\n\r\nThis verse is a supplication that Muslims recite in every unit of their daily prayers (Salah). It is a request to Allah for guidance along the straight path. To interpret this verse in light of other Quranic verses and Hadith (Prophetic traditions), we can consider the following:\r\n\r\nContextual Understanding: The concept of the \"straight path\" is further elucidated in other parts of the Quran. For example, in Surah Al-An\'am (6:153), Allah describes the path as the way of Islam, emphasizing the importance of following divine guidance and avoiding division and fragmentation.\r\n\r\nHadith Narrations: Various Hadith provide additional insights into the meaning of the straight path. For instance, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explained that the straight path refers to the path of righteousness, piety, and adherence to Islam. He likened it to a path that is well-defined and clear, leading to Allah\'s pleasure and paradise.\r\n\r\nTafsir (Exegesis): Scholars of Islam have written extensive commentaries on the Quran, known as Tafsir, which provide detailed explanations of each verse. Consulting reputable Tafsir works can offer a deeper understanding of the verse in question. Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Jalalayn, and others offer insights into the interpretation of Surah Al-Fatiha.\r\n\r\nOther Quranic Themes: The concept of guidance is a recurring theme in the Quran. Allah\'s guidance is contrasted with misguidance throughout the Quran, emphasizing the importance of seeking Allah\'s help to stay on the right path. Other verses that discuss guidance include Surah Al-Baqarah (2:256) and Surah Al-Muddathir (74:31).\r\n\r\nSpiritual and Moral Implications: The request for guidance in Surah Al-Fatiha reflects the believer\'s acknowledgment of their dependence on Allah\'s guidance in all aspects of life. It implies a desire to live in accordance with Allah\'s will, to make choices that align with moral and ethical principles, and to avoid straying from the path of righteousness.\r\n\r\nPractical Application: The verse encourages believers to seek Allah\'s guidance not only in matters of faith but also in their daily lives. It reminds them to make conscious efforts to follow the teachings of Islam and seek guidance from the Quran and Sunnah (traditions of the Prophet).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the request for guidance in Surah Al-Fatiha is a plea for divine assistance in following the path of righteousness and remaining steadfast in faith. This interpretation is informed by other Quranic verses, Hadith, scholarly exegesis, and the broader context of Islamic teachings. It serves as a reminder for believers to continuously seek Allah\'s guidance and strive to align their actions with His divine will.','2023-09-04 03:21:13.442509','2023-09-04 03:21:13.285822',1,NULL,'images/surah_fatiha_ayah_1_VX7E0Il.png'),(52,'How do you see the Surah Ar Rahman in your life?',NULL,'2023-09-04 03:22:28.207385','2023-09-04 03:22:28.203574',18,NULL,'');
